Installation steps
-------------------

Requirements
Kernel version 3.7 onwards
python 2.6.6 onwards

Run following commands as root

1) eio_cli installation
   > cp cli/eio_cli /sbin/
   > chmod 700 cli/eio_cli	
  

2) Man page
   Copy the  eio_cli.gz file under the man8 subdirectory of man directory (/usr/share/man/man8/).


3) Driver installation

   1. Let's say kernel sources are located at the path KERNEL_SRC and the driver has been downloaded
      at the path DRIVER_REPO
      Copy Driver/enhanceio dir under KERNEL_SRC/drivers/block
      Apply config patch.
      cd KERNEL_SRC; patch -p0 < DRIVER_REPO/Driver/config.patch

   2. Regenerate config file
      Run make menuconfig and save the configuration

   3. To compile:
      > cd KERNEL_SRC
      > make modules

   4. To install modules
      > make modules_install

4) manually load modules by running
   modprobe enhanceio_fifo
   modprobe enhanceio_lru
   modprobe enhanceio
   You can now create enhanceio caches using the utility eio_cli. Please refer
   to Documents/Persistence.txt for information about making a cache
   configuration persistent across reboot.
